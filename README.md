# Single Page Application Template

This is a basic setup for a single page application using [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/), [Crossroads.js](http://millermedeiros.github.io/crossroads.js/) and [Q](http://documentup.com/kriskowal/q/)

**This is WIP, but soon it will be ready to be used.**


# Demo

A demo is available by using python2.7 and the simple HTTP server script:

    gulp dev-build
    cd ./dev
    python2.7 /usr/lib/python2.7/SimpleHTTPServer.py

**Starting with 0.0.1 there will be an integrated server in order to ease the development**


# Install

**Coming soon**


# Documentation

**Coming soon**


# Build

The build system used is [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)

```gulp dev-build```

or

```gulp dev-build-watch```


The later will build the project and start watching for file changes.
