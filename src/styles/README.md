# Description

The build system processes **less** files by concatenating the ```main.less``` file from this
directory with the files from ```src/app``` directory.


### main.less

Imports third-party stylesheets and the variables.less file.


### variables.less

Defines the variables used throughout the application. This is where overwrites that are not
specific to components should be maintained.
